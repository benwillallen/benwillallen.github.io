		<p>On February 24th, the Russo-Ukrainian war took on a new face and level of importance as the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two. The tragic toll on Ukrainian life and land has been at the forefront on headlines ever since. In addition to these costs, the damage done to trade has also been a major focus with fears that the war could disrupt Ukrainian wheat production leading to shortages, higher inflation, and even famine in lower income countries.<br> On the other side of this story is Russia, where some of the earliest headlines looked at what sanctions should be placed on Russia. <br><br> The final piece of this puzzle comes in the form of international aid for Ukraine. The question of how Ukraine should be supported through military, humanitarian, and financial aid has grown to be controversial in the United States, and this makes it important to understand what aid has been provided in the first place. This project explores these aspects of the Russo-Ukrainian war beginning with an overview of the Russian and Ukrainian economies, moving to a breakdown of international aid for Ukraine, and finishing with a brief look at European imports of Russian energy products and sanctions placed on Russia.</p>
		<h2>Part 1 - Russia Versus Ukraine: Economies At War</h2>
		<p>To begin this analysis, the following interactive chart shows the GDP per capita, inflation rate, life expectancy, and the percent of GDP from agriculture for Ukraine and Russia. This data is shown from 1995 to 2019 and comes from World Bank Open Data and Gapminder.</p>

		<p>This next interactive chart summarizes the aspects from above in addition to total GDP and population by showing the median value for each aspect from 1995 to 2019.</p>
		<div class="center">

		</div>
		<p>Through these graphs, it is easy to see that Russia is simply a much larger country than Ukraine both in a literal landmass sense but also economically and in population figures. It is interesting to note the significantly higher economic growth over the past two decades for Russia compared to Ukraine when looking where both countries started at the beginning of the 21st century. This is further supported by looking at the GDP per capita of both countries that has been adjusted for purchasing power. Russia has seen much greater GDP per capita compared to Ukraine, and this is even with Russia having significantly more people. <br><br> Moving to the inflation rate, we see for both countries inflation has been highly volatile especially compared to places like the United States. It can also be seen that inflation rose rapidly after the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014. Finally, looking to the lower charts that Ukraine consistently has had a higher life expectancy compared to Russia as well as a higher percent of GDP based on the agricultural sector. This points to important piece of this project which is the impact on Ukraine as an agricultural exporter.
		</p>
		<h3>International Trade</h3>
		<p>The next aspect to look at between Russia and Ukraine is naturally their trade dynamics. Beginning with Ukraine, the following chart displays annual Ukrainian exports and imports over the past decade by continent.</p>
		<div class="center">
			<figure>
				<img src="UkraineExportsImports.png" alt="Description of your image">
			</figure>
		</div>
		<p>Here it is easy to see a few things; first, general trade activity decreased after both the 2014 Russian Annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the Russo-Ukraine war. This is expected due to the damage conflict brings to the production of goods as well as decreased confidence of foreign exporters about the stability of Ukraine. Additionally, it is appears the Ukraine tends to import slightly more than they export indicating that Ukraine is a net importer. <br><br> Finally, countries from Europe take in the largest share of Ukrainian exports, and similarly a significant majority of Ukrainian imports come from European countries. Ukraine's largest exports are metals, corn, wheat, and wood, and these exports have quite literally come under fire in the past year with concern being raised about the potential for famines in the lower income countries where Ukrainian wheat exports have been vital. Therefore it is valuable to understand the extent of damage to Ukrainian industries which can be seen in the following maps.</p>
		<figure>

		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="ExportsFromUkraine2022.png" alt="Description of your image" style="width: 50%;">
		</figure>
		<p>Evidently, these industries all seem to have been hit or at least slowed down, and the following chart makes this more obvious by visualizing the differences in exports between 2022 and 2021.</p>
		<div class="center">
			<figure>
				<img src="UkraineExportsDiff.png" alt="Description of your image">

			<img src="UkrainianExports2011to22.png" alt="Description of your image" style="float: right; width: 50%; padding-left: 20px;">
		</figure>
		<p>It is much clearer now that Ukrainian metal and ore exports decreased relatively uniformly across the world while corn, wheat, and wood exports were seen to surprisingly rise through much of Europe while decreasing else where. This could be explained by the loss of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol early in the war which was previously producing 15% of all Ukrainian steel. Events like this make it appear that the drop in exports was due primarily to real-world damage done to Ukrainian steel producers whereas the uneven distribution of which countries are importing corn, wheat, and wood from Ukraine indicates that the decrease in exports is due to politics and logistics. <br><br> Ukraine can export its goods to Europe without the need for shipping which is important due to Russia's naval dominance in the war. Of note however is the establishment of cooridors for Ukrainian goods, most notably wheat, to pass through without interference from the Russian navy. Treaties like these are the most likely reason why countries like Libya, Somalia, and Sudan have been able to export more Ukrainian wheat since the beginning of the invasion. It is also useful to look at the bigger picture and see how these export categories have changed over a larger time span as is seen in the following graph to the right.<br><br>Now looking at Russia, the following chart summarizes its total annual exports and imports by continent. Note that export data for 2022 is not available on a country by country basis, so the chart shows the International Monetary Fund estimate that exports decreased by 15%.</p>
		<div class="center">

		</div>
		<p>Here we see that Russian trade has followed a very similar pattern to what was seen with Ukraine. The sanctions placed on Russia after the 2014 annexation evidently led to Russian imports more than halving in 2015 and staying at that level into 2016. It also appears that Russia was also hit on the export side after 2014. The same thing is seen in 2022 where imports dropped to the lowest level seen in the past decade. Similar to before, this occured due to the even harsher sanctions placed on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine kicked off. There does appear a more pronounced effect on trade due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to Ukraine. While imports were not drastically affected, exports dropped by nearly $US 100 billion. A major difference between Russia and Ukraine that can be seen by comparing the two import-export graphs is that while Ukraine is somewhat more of a net importer, Russia exports significantly more than it imports making it a net exporter.<br><br>
		An important aspect of Russian trade is its high amount of exports for various energy sources to European countries. This has been a major cause of concern as it gives Russia leverage over European countries who have allied themselves with Ukraine. Fears have been raised that Russia will cut off this source of power to Europe and will leave it in the dark. To get a better sense of the issue at hand the following map visualizes which European countries relied the most on Russian energy exports.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="RussiaEnergyExports.png" alt="Description of your image" style="width: 60%; float:right;">
		</figure>
		<p>From the map it is seen that the Netherlands imported more than double what the next largest importer, Germany, imported. This was largely due to the Netherlands importing large amounts of refined petroleum from Russia. For example, in 2012 these imports reached their peak of almost $US 40 billion in Russian refined petroleum imports. However, these imports have dropped to a drastically smaller ~$US 942 million imported in 2020.<br><br> Of particular note for this project is that Ukraine imported on average about $US 1.6 billion of coal, oil, and electrical energy from Russia from 2011 to 2021. In 2021 this number remained steady at ~$US 1.59 billion. This naturally could present problems for Ukraine as they are now at war with what was previously a major source of power for the country. <br><br>It is worth pointing out that this graph shows the average amount each country imported from 2011 to 2021, so some countries may be importing less today than before however previous analysis indicated that demand had remained roughly the same throughout the decade. Naturally, the Russo-Ukraine war has changed this trading landscape, and while the data for 2022 was not available within the United Nations Comtrade data set, it can be assumed that imports from Russia for energy products has dropped substantially. Multiple European countries have already promised to ween off Russian energy, and sanctions have acted as a catalyst for this process.</p>
		<h2>Part 2 - Ukrainian Aid, Russian Sanctions</h2>
		<div class="center">
			<figure>
				<img src="UkraineAidChart.png" alt="The chart displays the amount of foreign aid given by the countries who have given the most and breaks it down further by what type of aid it is">
			</figure>
		</div>
		<p>The most obvious takeaway from this chart is that the United States has by far given the most amount of aid to Ukraine. Most of this aid has been in the form of military aid, and it can be seen that the United States has given more military aid to Ukraine than the combined amount of total aid provided by all other countries combined. Some other interesting findings from this chart is that while countries like the United States, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Poland have primarily given aid for military purposes, other countries like Germany and Japan have skewed more towards humanitarian and financial aid. What is most interesting is that Japan has actually given no military aid to Ukraine despite giving the 4th most aid overall. This is likely due to Japan's military being designed as a defensive force, as well as the impact of peace treaties from World War II that limited Japananese military expansion.</p>

		<iframe src="UkraineAidPercMapInteractive.html" style="width: 70%; height: 60vh; float: right;"></iframe>
		<p>Now looking at the geographic aspect, the following two interactive maps on the right side display the total amount of aid provided by country and the amount of aid provided per country as a percentage of the country's GDP.<br><br>The massive amount of aid given by the United States to Ukraine compared to the rest of the world can be seen on the map where the United States is the most shaded, and even the United Kingdom which gave the 2nd most aid is similarly colored to countries that gave very little aid. Regardless, this map also shows that most of the countries giving aid to Ukraine are in Europe. Outside of Europe and the United States, the largest aid providers are Japan and Canada. It is also worth noting that most of the foreign aid for Ukraine has come from countries that are a part of the NATO alliance.<br><br> The next map reveals a more interesting picture of foreign aid to Ukraine. While the United States in absolute terms has absolutely dominated the amount of aid given to Ukraine, relative to its GDP it has given a fairly modest amount of 0.37% of its total GDP to Ukraine. This is in comparison to the baltic states: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania which have contributed 1.1%, 1.24%, and 0.93% of their GDP respectively. The United States still has contributed an above average amount of aid relative to their GDP where the average percent of GDP committed to foreign aid for Ukraine was 0.25% among all countries that have given aid. <br><br></p>
		<p>To finish off this analysis, it is time to briefly look at which countries have placed sanctions on Russia. Sanctions refer to restrictions on trade that are made for political reasons to elicit some behavior or action from a foreign country. The following interactive map is based on Russia's own "Unfriendly Countries" list that contains countries that, according to the Russian government, have taken hostile actions against Russia. By and large these hostile actions are in the form of sanctions place on Russia. Before the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, only the United States and the Czech Republic were members of the list. However, this list was expanded to 49 total nations as more countries placed sanctions on Russia as a reaction against the war. </p>
		<div class="center">
			<iframe src="UnfriedMapInteractive.html" style="width: 100%; height: 80vh;"></iframe>
		</div>
		<p>One might notice that this map looks quite similar to the previous two maps in regards to which countries are colored. This makes sense as countries that are willing to give aid to Ukraine are more likely to be willing to also act against Ukraine's enemy, Russia. One notable exception to this is Turkey, who is the only NATO member that has not been deemed an "unfriendly" country by Russia.</p>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>

		</figure>
		<p>This project aimed to look at the Russo-Ukrainian war through the bigger picture of international trade and foreign aid. While Russia began the war as the seemingly obvious victor to be, indicted by their significantly larger economy and population, this has become far more uncertain due to Ukraine being bolstered by extensive foreign aid, and the Russian economy being crippled by sanctions. These effects are already being seen in figures like Russia's imports drastically decreasing in 2022. As 2023 continues and more data is available, it will be valuable to analyse this data to better understand the current state of the Russian and Ukrainian economies. Further analysis could also be directed towards a more granular look at the value provided by specific foreign aid agreements especially military aid.</p>
